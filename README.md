This repository contains dataset used in "SensorBuster: On Identifying Sensor Nodes in P2P Botnets"

Sality
=======
1. The files _SalityV3-##.gv_ are the pseudonymized snapshots of the Sality botnet at the lowest population of each of the seven days in our dataset.

2. The files _SalityV3-##-HourlyUptime.txt_ contain the uptimes of the nodes calculated based on their responses to Hello messages.

ZeroAccess (ZA)
===============
1. The files _ZA71-##.gv_ are the pseudonymized snapshots of the ZeroAccess botnet at the lowest population of each of the seven days in our dataset.

2. The files _ZA71-##-HourlyUptime.txt_ contain the uptimes of the ZA71 nodes based on the NL-exchange messages.

General
=======
1. The Files _ZA71FP_,_ZA71TP_,_SalityV3FP_ and _SalityV3TP_ contain the hashes of the nodes we identified as our ground truth for the evaluation.
